<p> In a culture that is steadily moving towards mathematics and sciences, young children often find themselves without a caring mentor for the arts. As such, many children lose interest in the arts at a young age, thereby losing an essential form of self expression. The primary purpose of UbiScope is to provide a solution to this problem by allowing the children to create tutorials for specific objects that they want to practice drawing.<br> 
In order to achieve this goal, we have designed an application for the Google Glass that works in a few simple steps. First, we allow the user to take a picture of a simple object with the Glass. The image is then processed by our application and turned into a sum of its multiple contours. Once the contours are defined and turned into simple shapes, the application will then show one contour at a time on the Glass display and child will be able to draw the specific part of the overall picture. As each part is drawn, the application will compare the drawn contour with the expected contour and give feedback. This will continue until all the contours are drawn, helping the child make a drawing out of its simple parts.<br>
We believe that this could have a massive impact on young children who generally lose interest quite quickly without guidance. As previously stated, there is generally less of a nudge towards the finer arts for younger children, and this can result in a lack of interest that can last a lifetime. We hope to counter this problem by giving the child an opportunity to draw objects that may interest them. We hope that by doing so, we can spark a fire that may never have started otherwise. </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technology Used:</h3>

<p> We are Using Google Glass as our Form Factor. Reason for Using Glass is that it fits perfectly on the eyes of children, and provides a good AR solution without being too bulky and disruptive. The Speech and tap controls also make it very easy to use for out target audience. </p>

<p>Education and Hobbies <br> Although our application is targeted at children who want to learn how to draw, This could very well be extended to any budding artist/cartoonist with a great idea but insufficient artistic skills. Biology and architecture students can also use this solution to help them draw complex diagrams.</p>
